## [0.0.8] - 24-04-2026

- **Core**: Added `stream.prefetchState` — observable lifecycle of mpv's background playlist-prefetch (`MpvPrefetchState`: `idle`, `loading`, `ready`, `used`). Backed by a patched mpv `prefetch-state` read-only property, so the signal is identical across all demuxer backends (HLS, DASH, raw HTTP, SMB, local).
- **Core**: Added `stream.seekCompleted` — an authoritative "seek finished" signal backed by `MPV_EVENT_PLAYBACK_RESTART`. Fires exactly when mpv has reinitialized playback after a seek (or initial file load).
- **Fixed**: Seek / playback-restart events no longer emit a spurious `position = 0` on `positionStream`. The previous implementation forwarded mpv's `MPV_EVENT_SEEK` and `MPV_EVENT_PLAYBACK_RESTART` as a synthetic `_seek` property with value `0`, which then flowed through `_updatePosition()` and briefly jammed the position stream to zero on every seek. The two events are now forwarded as dedicated `MpvEventPlaybackSeek` / `MpvEventPlaybackRestart` messages, and on playback-restart the main isolate polls `time-pos` synchronously so the real post-seek position is visible on `positionStream` before any throttled observer update.
- **Example**: Rewrote the seek slider in `PlaybackTab` to release its drag value via `stream.seekCompleted` instead of a fixed `Future.delayed(500ms)` — demonstrates the intended usage pattern for the new stream.
- **Build**: Patched mpv's `prefetch_next()` to run the `on_load` hook before the opener thread spawns, so custom URL schemes (e.g. `plex-transcode://`) also resolve for prefetched tracks. Upstream mpv skipped hooks on the prefetch path, which hit the stream layer with unresolved URLs and failed with "No protocol handler found".
- **Build**: Patched ffmpeg's mov demuxer for the `advanced_editlist` option on fragmented MP4. Upstream silently forces it to `0` for fMP4, ignoring whatever the user sets — which drops AAC encoder priming edit lists and causes an audible click at every segment boundary on well-formed DASH streams. The patch removes the override so the user-supplied value (default `1`) is respected; set `demuxer-lavf-o=advanced_editlist=0` to restore upstream behavior for sources with malformed per-segment edit lists.
- **Build**: Patched ffmpeg's DASH demuxer to reuse a single TCP connection across segment GETs (HTTP and HTTPS), matching the `http_persistent` behaviour HLS already has.
- **Build**: Updated libmpv binaries to `libmpv-r4` across all platforms.

## [0.0.7] - 12-04-2026

- **Core**: Patched audio-format (u8, s16, s32, float, etc.) to allow instant reset to default — setting it to `"no"` (newly accepted) or `""` now resets the format immediately, while previously a full player restart was required.
- **Example**: Updated deprecated APIs that prevented the app from running.
- **Build**: Updated libmpv binaries to `libmpv-r3` across all platforms.

## [0.0.6] - 08-04-2026

- **Core**: Added SMB2/3 protocol support (`smb2://`) for Samba/CIFS network shares via patched libsmb2.
- **Core**: Typed error stream — `Stream<MpvPlayerError>` (sealed: `MpvEndFileError`, `MpvLogError`) replaces `Stream<String>`.
- **Core**: Added `stream.endFile` (`MpvFileEndedEvent`) for all file-end events, including premature EOF detection.
- **Core**: Added `stream.pausedForCache` and `stream.demuxerViaNetwork` for network state monitoring.
- **Core**: Added optional `timeout` parameter to `registerHook` for automatic safety continuation.
- **Fixed**: Incorrect name for audio-stream-silence property.
- **Build**: Updated libmpv binaries from `libmpv-r1` to `libmpv-r2` across all platforms.

## [0.0.5+1] - 30-03-2026

- **README**: Improved documentation.

## [0.0.5] - 24-03-2026

- **Core**: Added stream hooks API (`registerHook`, `continueHook`, `player.stream.hook`) to intercept mpv's file-loading pipeline.
- **README**: Documentation fixes and consistency improvements.

## [0.0.4] - 23-03-2026

- **Core**: Added new APIs to configure embedded and external cover art handling (`setAudioDisplay`, `setCoverArtAuto`, `setImageDisplayDuration`).
- **Core**: Fast jump into playlist now automatically starts playback.
- **Example**: Refined Queue tab design and improved stability.
- **Example**: Added new sliders to DSP filters.

## [0.0.3+2] - 21-03-2026

- Minor fixes.

## [0.0.3+1] - 21-03-2026

- **GitHub Release**: New tag system for versioning libmpv binaries to avoid conflicts with the same release on GitHub. From now on every important update to libmpv (like 0.0.3 Linux fix) will have a new tag and a new release (libmpv-r1, libmpv-r2, etc.). This avoids confusion with the pub version number and ensures users with old SHAs can still use their version when downloading instead of breaking the build.

## [0.0.3] - 21-03-2026

- **Linux**: Bumped minimum supported OS version to Ubuntu 24.04 required because `mpv 0.41.0` enforced a strict dependency on `libpipewire-0.3 >= 0.3.57` for its native PipeWire backend.
- **README**: Added a detailed *Troubleshooting* section in the README explaining how to correctly satisfy Linux system dependencies when building on containers.
- **Example**: Fixed AO menu not showing the default driver automatically.

## [0.0.2+3] - 20-03-2026

- Updated Linux libmpv, ALSA, Pipewire and Pulse now all work without external dependencies.

## [0.0.2+2] - 18-03-2026

## [0.0.2] - 17-03-2026

- New extended documentation.
- Fixed filepicker on macOS.
- Restructured settings UI in example app by mpv property each have their own dedicated page and stream lab moved to main navigation.
- Other audio engine fixes.

## [0.0.1+9] - 16-03-2026

- Re-added audiounit driver together with avfoundation in libmpv for iOS. Audio_service now works with both.
- Added new option to choose AO driver in example app.
- Added audio_service to example app to test native controls of the OS.
